### A Note On "New"
I tend to have assumptions, a lot of them, as I do things.
I created "new" with that in mind, as a way to face that headlong. This will grow as I do, and your mileage may vary.
The ENV NEW\_NOTE will be checked, where you can hold a copy of your ideal new, should you wish to use your own implementation.
